# Sentiments Implementation

## Prerequisite

In order to start using Sentiments on your services \(e.g. IS and/or TS\), you should ensure that you have fulfilled the following prerequisites:

* Informational Service/Transactional Service should be registered on WOGAA
* Informational Service should have implemented or updated with the [latest wogaa.js](/web-analytics/web-implement-and-verify/#implement-and-verify-code-in-production) code
* Transactional Service should have completed implementation for the [Start and End Trigger Codes](/web-analytics/web-implement-ts/#implement-and-verify-event-code) of your service\(s\)

## Onboard Sentiments

As of 30 Sep 2019, agencies are able to activate WOGAA Sentiments for their respective services. This can be activated by following the guided steps on wogaa.sg under _Manage Sentiments_.

* ~~~~[~~Enabling Sentiments for your Informational Service \(IS\)~~]()~~~~
* ~~~~[~~Enabling Sentiments for your Transactional Service \(TS\)~~]()~~~~
  * ~~~~[~~Enable Sentiments for Multiple Transactional Services~~]()~~~~
* ~~~~[~~Testing Sentiments on Non-Prod Environments~~]()~~~~

## Enabling Sentiments on your Informational Service \(IS\)

To begin with, **Step 1** - Click on **Sentiments**, then **Manage Sentiments**

 **Step 2** - Enter the Service Name on the search bar or navigate through the list to select the service you want to enable Sentiments for by clicking the eye icon - **MANAGE SENTIMENTS**

 **Step 3** - Choose on the services \(IS or TS\) that you want to enable Sentiments for. Click on the **Sentiments Status** toggle, it allows you to toggle the Sentiments widget appearing on your site/service on or off. This will immediately halt all data collection from Sentiments the moment you turn it off.

Here you will see a modal dialog pops-up where you can confirm the activation of Sentiments on your Live Site.

And thatâ€™s it! You have successfully activated Sentiments on your Production/Live Service.

## Enabling Sentiments on your Transactional Service \(TS\)

Since Transactional Service\(s\) are grouped according to their respective IS \(es\) under Digital Service Register \(DSR\), **it is required for the IS to be verified first** before you can start enabling Sentiments on your individual TS\(es\).

To enable Sentiments on a TS, you first need to select the IS that your TS resides in, under **Manage Sentiments**, then follow through [similar steps]() as described above for enabling Sentiments on an IS.

### Enable Sentiments for Multiple Transactional Services

If you need to enable Sentiments for multiples TS\(es\) at one go, click on the **Select All \(1\)** checkbox and then click on **ACTIVATE \(2\)**. Sentiments will then be successfully enabled for all the selected TS\(es\).

## Testing Sentiments on Non-Prod Environments

To test out the behaviour and interaction of Sentiments on your Non-Production \(e.g. Development, QA, Staging\) Environments, you can simply select on the **Test Environment** Tab and by clicking on the **REGISTER TEST ENVIRONMENT** and enter your Non-Prod domain name \(_without the path_\) into the text field.

`For e.g. "http://[dev,stg,qa].example.com"`

_Note: Make sure your Non-Prod Environment\(s\) is using the right_ [_testing script tag_](/web-analytics/web-implement-and-verify/#implement-and-verify-code-in-test-environment)_._
